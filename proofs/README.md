# Proof artifacts

This repo keeps proof artifacts under `proofs/`:

- `proofs/lean/`: a small, self-contained Lean 4 bundle (run `cd proofs/lean && lake build`)
- `proofs/policy_algebra/`: Lean spec + auxiliary proof for policy-algebra “veto-first” semantics
- `proofs/tau-mprd-compiler/`: verification artifacts for `tools/tau-mprd-compiler/`
